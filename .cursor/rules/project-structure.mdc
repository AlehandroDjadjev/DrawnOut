# Project Structure — Active Frontend

The **active frontend** for this project is `whiteboard_demo/`, NOT `frontend/`.

## Rules

- All frontend work (UI, pages, services, providers, models) MUST be done in `whiteboard_demo/lib/`.
- **Never read, edit, or create files** inside `frontend/lib/` unless the user explicitly asks you to.
- When searching for existing code to reuse or extend, search in `whiteboard_demo/lib/` first.
- Route, page, and service references (e.g. `AuthService`, `DeveloperModeProvider`, `LessonApiService`) should always resolve to `whiteboard_demo/lib/`.

## Why

The `frontend/` folder is an older/parallel codebase that is **not actively used**. Changes there have no effect on the running app and waste effort.
